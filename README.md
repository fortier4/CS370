•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

Project Two involved programing a pirate intelligent agent using python.  The pirate intelligent agent was programmed to navigate a maze from start to finish.  Said intelligent agent was designed to reach to goal with the highest reward using reinforcement learning.  This is a tactic that uses positive rewards for desirable behavior, and negative rewards for undesirable behavior.  The code that was given completed the basic structure for the program.  Then the code that I wrote finished off the program in order to produce the desired output.
  
•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
•	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
•	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
•	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer Scientists work hard every day to keep the vast and intricate system of technology that society depends on functioning.  This matters because society has become so dependent on technology and if this technology disappeared or started to fail then society as we know it would collapse.  To approach a problem as a computer scientist, I first try to understand why the question is being asked.  This motivation is what leads the way to discovering the solution to the problem.  As a computer scientist it is my ethical responsibility to the end user and the organization to always remain professional, confidential, and respectful.
